# To run this properly you also need a backend:

The Contacts app project that we're building is a front-end project. However, we'll eventually be storing the contacts on a backend server. Since we're only really focusing on the front-end for this course, we've gone ahead and built this server for you so you can focus on just the React parts of this program.

The server is just a simple Node/Express app. The repo for the project is at https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-server. All you need to do is:

1. clone the project with git clone https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-server.git
2. install the project dependencies with npm install
3. start the server with node server.js

Once you've started the server, you can forget about it. The Contacts project we're working on will interact with this server, but we won't ever modify any of the server code.
